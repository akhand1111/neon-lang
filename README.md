# Simple Language

This is an implementation of a simple language intended to demonstrate the following concepts:

* Lexing
* Parsing
* Interpreting
* Compilation
* Execution

At this time, the only data type supported is integer. Assignments are possible:

    a := 5

Four function arithmetic is available:

    b := 5 * (6 + 7)

and there are two built-in functions:

    c := abs(5 - 9)
    print(c)
